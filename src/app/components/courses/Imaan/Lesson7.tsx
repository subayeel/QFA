            Let's think about something we all do. When you buy a new phone or
            appliance, what's always included in the box? An instruction manual,
            right? It shows you how to use it properly, what to do and what not
            to do, and all the important warnings.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            In a similar way, we believe God has sent us an instruction manual
            for life—the Quran. It guides us on how to live, what to do and
            avoid, and gives us important warnings and recommendations for our
            journey through life.

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            But why should we believe the Quran is actually from God? Let's
            explore some really fascinating reasons that might surprise you!

          <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            One of the most amazing things about the Quran is how perfectly it's
            been preserved over 1,400 years. The Quran itself makes a bold
            promise about this:

            This isn't just a claim—it's a reality you can verify yourself! You
            could pick up a copy of the Quran from anywhere in the world today
            and compare it with manuscripts dating back to within thirty years
            after Prophet Muhammad's time, and you'd find the text to be exactly
            the same (apart from writing style and pronunciation marks).

            This challenge is fascinating because the shortest chapter in the

            time—master poets and linguistic experts who took immense pride in
            their language skills. Yet many of them embraced Islam just from
            hearing the Quran being recited. Despite their expertise, they
            couldn't meet this seemingly simple challenge.

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            The unique literary style of the Quran—neither poetry nor prose but
            something entirely distinct—continues to captivate listeners, even
            those who don't understand Arabic often find its recitation moving
            and powerful.

            This challenge invites readers to examine the Quran critically,
            searching for contradictions or inconsistencies—a level of
            confidence that suggests it knows it will pass such examination.

            The Quran contains statements about history, science, and the
            natural world that are remarkably accurate—especially considering
            the time and place it was revealed.

                  The Quran correctly refers to the ruler in Joseph's time as a
                  "King" but in Moses' time as "Pharaoh"—matching what we now
                  know from historical records.

                  The Quran describes natural phenomena in ways that made sense
                  to ancient audiences but also align with modern discoveries.

          <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            For example, consider how the Quran describes the origins of the
            universe:
          </p>

          <div className="bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 rounded-lg p-6 my-8 border-l-4 border-blue-300 dark:border-blue-600">

              "Do the disbelievers not realize that the heavens and earth were
              once one mass then We split them apart?"
            </p>
            <p className="text-right text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
              — Quran 21:30

          <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            For a 7th century audience, this description made sense, but for us
            today, it also aligns with our understanding of the universe
            beginning from a singularity (what scientists call the Big Bang).
          </p>

          <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            Similarly, the Quran's description of embryonic development uses the
            Arabic word "alaqah"—which can mean a clinging substance, a
            leech-like structure, or a blood clot. When we look at an embryo
            around days 22-25, it does indeed resemble a leech and is clinging
            to the uterine wall!
          </p>

              Remember, the Quran isn't meant to be a science textbook—it's a
              book of guidance. These fascinating alignments with modern
              knowledge are signs for reflection, not scientific claims. Science
              constantly evolves with new discoveries, while the Quran's purpose
              is to invite us to contemplate the Creator's wisdom and power.

          <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            When we look at all these aspects together—the Quran's perfect
            preservation, its inimitable style, its clear and consistent message
            about God, its universal values, its invitation to scrutiny, and its
            remarkable accuracies—a compelling picture emerges.

          <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            These qualities suggest that the Quran isn't just another book
            written by humans, but rather a divine revelation—our instruction
            manual for life from the Creator Himself.

            Just as we would trust the manufacturer's guide to show us how to
            use our devices properly, the Quran offers guidance on how to live
            our lives in accordance with our Creator's wisdom and purpose.

            The Quran is a miracle in itself. It is a book that has been

            has been proven to be the word of God by the most sophisticated
            scientific and historical methods.
