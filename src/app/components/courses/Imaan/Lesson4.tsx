            Now that we've explored God's existence and oneness, let's talk
            about something really fascinating—why would this Creator want to

            there's One Creator.

              When we think about suffering, it's important to remember a few

                <span>
                  The existence of suffering doesn't disprove God—we've already
                  established logical reasons why God exists.
                </span>
              </li>

                />
                <span>
                  This question is often more emotional than logical—it's about
                  understanding, not proving.

                <span>
                  The only way to truly know the purpose behind suffering is if

            This is just one example where human reasoning alone can't give us
            complete answers. Our minds are amazing, but limited. Just like a
            smartphone user needs the manufacturer's guide to fully understand
            all its features, we need guidance from our Creator to understand
            life's deepest aspects.
