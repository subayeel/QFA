            Once you complete this course, set out on a journey to places where
            you can find true peace. Take time to sit quietly, reflect on the
            countless blessings you have been given, and open your eyes to the
            beauty of Allah's creation all around you. Let your heart overflow
            with gratitude to Allah for everything He has granted you.
          </p>

            Now, make it your mission to truly understand your purpose in life.
            Step by step, begin cutting off the actions, habits, and even
            friendships that pull you away from the path of Deen. Remind
            yourself: you are a traveler in this world. Your stay here is
            temporary, and your true destination depends entirely on the actions
            you carry out in this life.

            <li>Travel and reflect.</li>

            <li>Remove distractions that distance you from Allah.</li>
            <li>Strengthen your Deen with purpose and consistency.</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
            This journey is yours, embrace it with determination, and let every
            step bring you closer to your ultimate destination.
